# String

String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

Strings can be output to screen using the print function. For example: print("hello").

Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
```
a="this is a string"
```

# Printing String Literals

String literals can be printed using the print function.

Use ' ' **single quotes** or " " **double quotes** for single line printing and ''' ''' **three single quotes** for multi line printing.
```
print('Hello World')
print("Hello World")
print('Hello\nWorld')
print('''Hello
         World''')
```
Output:
```
Hello World
Hello World
Hello
World
Hello
World
```
