# Lists

* Lists are a collection which is ordered and changeable.
* Written within square brackets.
* They also allow duplicate members.
* Lists also contain different data types.

Example:

Input:
```
l=[12,23.2,"abc",12]
print(l)
```
Output:
```
[12,23.2,"abc",12]
```

All elements in the list are ordered from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of elements in the list.

In the above example:
```
l[0]=12
l[1]=23.2
l[2]="abc"
l[3]=12
```
