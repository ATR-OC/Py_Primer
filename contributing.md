# Contributing Guidelines

So you have gone through Py_Primer and now want to start contributing.
That's great! Python is always changing and keeping the primer relevent is
an important task.


### Wait! Why should I even bother reading this?

We want to keep it easy to contribute and maintaing structure is the best
way to prevent anarchy. Ok I'm being a bit melodramatic here. We just want the
process of contributing to flow smoothly with out any hitches.

### What kind of contributions are you even looking for?

Almost any kind of contribution is welcome as long as the guidelines are
followed. No contribution is too small. Go ahead and correct grammar or spelling
mistakes. Add a new topic or even a new feature is you're up to it!

## The Ground Rules
#### (Don't panic! There are only two)


If you want to update present topics or example code; go ahead and
pull a request after making your own fork and adding your changes.


If you want to do something a little bigger such as adding a new file or feature;
in that case open an issue and discuss how to go about it there before making any changes.
