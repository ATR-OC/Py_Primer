Now let us look at some of the inbuilt functions (that you need to byheart lol).

# Inbuilt Functions

Modules are basically header files in python, which you can `link` your program to to get access to a vast collection of 
functions and features. 

To 'import' a module into your program, you can use the following syntax:

```python

import modulename

```
That's it! Now you can use the vast amount of functions and features that the module provides in your program, without having
to write new functions yourself!

## Math Module

The math module contains various functions that can be useful for mathematical functionality in your program. A few useful
functions include:

### math.pow( a , b )  

`This function will output the number "a raised to the power b"`

```python
math.pow(2,3)     # Input
>>>8              # Output
```
### math.sqrt(a) 

`This function will output the square root of a`

```python
math.sqrt(49)     # Input
>>>7              # Output
```

### math.sin(a)

`This function will return the trignometric sine ratio of a *radians* `

```python
math.sin( math.pi / 2 )     # Input: math.pi can be used to get an accurate value of π
>>>8                        # Output
```
### math.log10(a)

`This function will return the log a to the base 10 value.`

```python
math.log10(1000)         # Input
>>>3                     # Output
```


# Composition of functions

Functions have a very useful feature where we can give a specific function as an argument for another function. This is 
particularly useful in the following example:

```python

math.pow( math.sin(π/6) , 2)  # Input: (sin30)^2
>>>0.25                       # Output
```
